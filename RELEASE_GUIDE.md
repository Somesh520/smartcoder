# How to Create a Downloadable Release on GitHub

1.  **Open your GitHub Repository** in the browser.
2.  Look for **"Releases"** on the right sidebar (or go to `/releases`).
3.  Click **"Draft a new release"** (or "Create a new release").
4.  **Choose a Tag**: Enter `v1.0.0` (or `v0.1`) and create it.
5.  **Release Title**: Give it a name like "SmartCoder Extension v1.0".
6.  **Description**: Write a description (e.g., "First release of the LeetCode Sync Extension").
7.  **Attach Binaries**:
    *   Drag and drop the `leetcode-sync-extension.zip` file I just created for you.
    *   (It is located in your project root: `/Users/somesh/smartcoder/leetcode-sync-extension.zip`).
8.  I also recommend uploading the unpacked `.crx` if you have one, but the ZIP is standard.
9.  Click **"Publish Release"**.

Now anyone can download the `.zip` from the "Assets" section of that release!
